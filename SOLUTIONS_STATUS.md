## 💡 Current Workaround:

The explanation field currently says "Solution for question X". 

We can update this to say:
"Refer to the [Topic Name] explanation above for the step-by-step method to solve this type of problem."

This guides students back to the detailed topic explanations which already contain the methodology.
